# DeepLoc-Protein-Localization
Implementation of a model inspired by the DeepLoc 2.1 paper: DeepLoc 2.1: improved protein subcellular localization prediction using deep learning
 (Almagro Armenteros et al., 2017).

Highlights:
- Protein sequence preprocessing (BLOSUM encoding, padding)
- Multi-task architecture (location + membrane type)
- Evaluation: confusion matrices and per-class metrics

Execution: The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab for easy GPU access. Open the .ipynb file directly in Colab to install dependencies and train the model without local setup.
